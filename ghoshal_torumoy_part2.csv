For the benefit of people who are shaky on stats, the margin of error basically means that there's a 95% probability that the actual result will fall between poll-margin and poll+margin. Because the possible outcomes follow a normal distribution, the probability of the result being outside the margin goes down exponentially as the distance increases.

The cumulative margin of error with all polls and states was 2%, actual discrepancy was 4.8%. That means that the actual result was almost five standard deviations away from predicted (margin of error is two standard deviations).

12.7% of the world's population lives below the lowest poverty line (

$21B/900M/($1.90 per day) gives about 12 days out of poverty if they were making effectively $0 before the infusion. If they were close to the line, let's say making $1.80, then they would be out of poverty for about eight months (243.8 days). 

Either way, the quote seems inaccurate or misleading (it's phrased as ""poverty's gone forever!"" instead of ""poverty's gone for a couple of weeks!""). The very wealthiest people aren't sufficiently wealthy when you spread their cash over the huge number of people who make effectively nothing.

Men die in the wars so that terror never gets here in the first place. Or some of them have to suffer the emotional scarring of being tricked into fighting for a corporation, or just the fact that they watched their friends die. Male veteran homelessness is through the roof. Cases of PTSD and alcoholism are abundant. There's an undertone of male disposability that is prominent in society, some of which currently in here, that's not only expressed by men going to die in war for the good of everyone else, it's emboldened by it. Specifically because their voices are gone. Like male trauma is not even counted, and you have the audacity to say women suffer more from war. 

That's a western interpretation of this frame, because what war is to us, women have it easy here, thus Clinton being the one to say this is pretty offensive, even though it was over 20 years ago. 

Globally there's a better case for your/her point, but it's frame is still completely bias and dismissive of the horrors men go through in war. War in itself is bad for women, third world countries and civil wars specifically, but the gravity of a life is lost on this conversation. Men not being there to suffer with them in the first place isn't even included, and it spits on all those who gave up their life, so the ones left would have the right to live, the right to experience more things in this existence. Love, raise kids, and risk suffering from society at that point forward. Men gave up the very opportunity to suffer, it's a bigger price.

Many aspects of war affect women and girls disproportionately.  According to recent studies on life expectancy among unarmed civilians caught in armed conflict, women are the primary adult victims of war. (13)  For example, a unique harm of war on women is the trauma inflicted by military brothels, rape camps, sex trafficking for prostitution, and increased domestic violence.  In addition, widows of war and women refugees of war are particularly vulnerable to poverty, prostitution, and higher illness and death following armed conflict.  Furthermore, it has been documented that senior officers of war have commonly accepted and sanctioned the sexual exploitation of local women by military men. (14)(15)(16)

The argument that you make is that women, because they are still benefittiong from a patriarchal entitlement to be the weak and precious gender that needs to be protected and coddled, never experience the full hardship of war, because most states where feminists are a voice keep females out of of frontline combat.

So, if you want to make that argument, be prepared that I will ask you, how many female veterans commit suicide, and how many men. I will ask you, How many women on average survive an engagement, how many men. I will ask you, How many treatment options for females that suffer from PTSD, or any mental health problems are open. I will ask you, how much money has been spent for treatment options that are accessible to males, how much for treatment options that are accessible to females? I will ask how many of them are open to admitting men. I will ask you, who has the higher injury rates among armed forces and civillians combined, men or women. How about the higher self medication rate with alcohol / legal drugs? How about what gets you more of a payout, being the victim of domestic violence, or being a corpse in war?

You want to talk victims of war? Be fucking honest about it. I do not deny that women suffer in war, and that living with the memories of war is a fucking horrific thing for anybody. 

But to say ""being alive is the worst punishment of all"" denies the fact that the rest is, you know, dead. Not alive anymore. That is why the survivors have things like survivors guilt. even they recognise, on a personal basis, that a lot of those who died would have given anything to just have survived. 

To exclude them from the picture is like saying, oh, yea, it was really bad that he murdered all those people, but look at what he has to live with for the rest of his life. OOh, it is really bad that she poured boiling water on her baby untill it stopped screaming, but I think she is punished enough by havuing to live with that. 

That is why in every trial, in every judgement, if you have the victim no longer present, or able to testify, you have a person who speaks for them. Who reminds us, that yes, the person is looking pretty sad and small and non threatening now, but I am here to speak for those who can no longer be with us, thanks to the persons action. 

You want to read her argument rephrased? 

""Men have no domestic partners to lose. 

Men have no partens to lose. 

Men have no children to lose. 

Men no longer have homes to flee from. 

Men will never be able to know an other home. 

Men can not be refugees from Conflicts, and if they are their victims, most would consider it business as usual. 

Men can never see their children anymore, much less raise them. 

Men no longer suffer from crime or domestic violence. 

Because the men no longer exist. 

they have ceased to exist when they get drafted, often against their will, in conflicts trhat are not their own to fight. 

The have been drafted, because their own countries determines, that the value of a mans life is less then the value of a womans life, and we have allways send our men to war. 

They have ceased to exist when they were moved out of womans sight. 

They have ceased to exist when politics considers them expendable. 

They have ceased to exist when they are dead, hoping to their last breath that maybe, just maybe, their death could have some meaning, and maybe the fact that because of them some man woman or child continued to live could give their senseless death some meaning. 

Men have ceased to exist, because their voices no longer can be heard. Because they are not wanted. 

It is very easy to focus on women. Especially, if you never had the human kindness in your heart for an other stranger. 

They say in every man is a warrior waiting to be awakened. 

I say it differently. In every man, there is a little boy, sared out of his wits. That gets hit end scolded every time he wants to say something, so he retreats in his shell more. he can not find comfort in men, because the other men are scared little boys as well that do not want to show it, for fear of being hit more. 
So this young boy has ceased to exist. But while the young bo has no voice, and can't voice his feelings, he can imagne, very vividly, what it is to go to war. Because in war, the little boy exists. 

Because he is expendable. If he refuses to go to war, many countries viciously punish the little boy for not following orders. They lock him up because he refuses to kill other little boys. 

But the truth is, no matter how well hidden the luittle boy is, the little boy continues to be there. And even if people justify it thousands of times for the little boy, the little boy knows one thing in the depth of his heart. He is expendable, as soon as he picks up a weapon. Life will go on. His girlfriend will find an othjer one, his parents will mourn him a bit, his children will grow up seeing a photo on their desks, if anything. 

But i he dies, all he will ever be, ever can be, or ever hoped and wanted to be ends that moment. because the second he picked up a weapon, he became expendable. 

So he knows that the little boys that his superior told him are just as scared as he is, but they are just as expendable. And just by an accident of birth, they could have lived his life. he could have lived theirs. 

So the little boys, that tossed their lives away because politicians said the war had to be fought, because they were punished if they did not show up to the military, because they were ""whipped into discipline"", that never had a voice or someone that listened to them, that were expendable from the day they were born, hear that a woman says that women are the real losers of war. 

Sure they are. 

Because the little boys have ceased to exist once they died. 
To be a victim, you need to be alive. 
And it is just so convenient to forget all that. 

And it is very hard to really get what goes through the mind of a black woman that has to flee a warzone with her children in her hand, nd the clothes on her back, especially if you are a white older woman that was never even been close to a country where hunger was a problem. 

But for a man, it is very easy to imagine being dead. Because we want to live. And most of us have experienced, or will experience, being in a situation where we could be forced in the military. because, we are expendable. How can something expendable suffer in war?

My grandpa actually lived his whole life without knowing, until the very end of his life, he was scrapbooking, and noticed his birth certificate had the ""wrong"" date on it, and it was before the date on his parent's marriage certificate. Due to the scandal of illegitimacy and her virtue etc, it was all hushed up.

My grandma knew way before actually, because my ""great grandpa"" and his brothers had a seizure issue, which my grandma was worried about her husband having, or getting passed on to her kids. One of my great-great aunts came to her one day and told her she didn't need to worry about it, and why. 

Anyway, there are two likely candidates for who I'm descended from, both farmhands who were known to be a little too close with great grandma. So, either a german guy, or the native guy. It would put me at 1/8-16th native.

In retrospect, its pretty obvious, my grandpa and his kids look nothing like his brothers or their kids. My family all has a very stereotypical ""indian"" nose.  I personally can't get tested for this, because it would come through my mom, and the ancestry tests cant switch chromosomes like that. But some of my cousins have talked about it.

In the years before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia contributed at least $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, the philanthropic enterprise she has overseen with her husband, former president Bill Clinton. Just two months before the deal was finalized, Boeing -- the defense contractor that manufactures one of the fighter jets the Saudis were especially keen to acquire, the F-15 -- contributed $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to a company press release.

The Saudi deal was one of dozens of arms sales approved by Hillary Clinton’s State Department that placed weapons in the hands of governments that had also donated money to the Clinton family philanthropic empire, an International Business Times investigation has found.

...

The Clinton-led State Department also authorized $151 billion of separate Pentagon-brokered deals for 16 of the countries that donated to the Clinton Foundation, resulting in a 143 percent increase in completed sales to those nations over the same time frame during the Bush administration. 

...

American defense contractors also donated to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state and in some cases made personal payments to Bill Clinton for speaking engagements. Such firms and their subsidiaries were listed as contractors in $163 billion worth of Pentagon-negotiated deals that were authorized by the Clinton State Department between 2009 and 2012.

...

In all, governments and corporations involved in the arms deals approved by Clinton’s State Department have delivered between $54 million and $141 million to the Clinton Foundation as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the Clinton family, according to foundation and State Department records. The Clinton Foundation publishes only a rough range of individual contributors’ donations, making a more precise accounting impossible.

What you might possibly be confused by, is that the US is the largest seller (in dollar amount) of weapons compared to all other countries. So although its not our largest export, the US is the largest exporter of arms.

Before and after Clinton's State Department, we still led the world in exports, but we sold far more while she held the office (nearly triple some years).

Not anybody, there are lots of restrictions forbidding weapons sales, including to countries under sanction for war crimes, atrocities, and for supporting terrorists; all of which apply to Saudi Arabia. 

There are many dictatorships that US arms dealers are not legally allowed to do business with, who have committed far fewer war crimes and human rights abuses, and who have been less involved in allowing terrorist funding, than Saudi Arabia.

Actually, there is another restriction for American weapons manufacturers, and that is a prohibition against selling weapons to countries that conscript child soldiers. The dictatorship in Yemen was given a special exemption to that law, and that dictatorship is the one the Saudis are trying to return to power, and they are still using conscripted child soldiers. 

we will protect the oil market

Seriously? Less than 10% of Saudi oil is sold to the US, while over 50% of Saudi oil goes to China. China doesn't pay in US dollars so those oil sales don't even effect the world market, the Saudis have refineries, and a nationwide network of gas stations, and they get paid at the pump in local currency. China also builds massive infrastructure projects, like airports, bridges, rail, and ports in Saudi Arabia and the GCC in exchange for Gulf oil. 

Also, Iraq has one of the world's largest oil supplies, and 12 years of sanctions, and almost 6 years of war (including the largest bombing since Vietnam) wasn't exactly 'protecting the oil market'. In fact it completely derailed it, and oil went from being $10-15 a barrel to $150 at the height of the insurgency as one of the largest supplies was taken offline.

No. I have never seen that meme before, until I started looking for the video today. That meme seems created or popularized by fact-checking websites and rightwing websites with a similar article.

It was a video. I don't think it was the Oprah video. In the Oprah video, Trump sits at the right of the camera and faces the left (towards Oprah / people). I recall that interview was the other way around (camera on the right). But since videos are often and easily mirrored in a try to prevent YouTube's automated detection, this could be irrelevant.

It's entirely accidentally the source of many false convictions. People remember what they want to remember, even if only because someone else wants them to remember it.

That being said, it's likely as not that they remember it because it DID happen, but in any conversation where the topic comes up before the recollection, it's slightly suspect, just because it seems like something he would say, so it's easy to imagine. Regardless of whether he said it, people believe it's true so imagining he said it is very easy next step.

Either way, the ACA (obamacare) did a lot of things right, but it absolutely isn't a perfect system and people on the left really aren't always crazy about it either. 

One of the major criticisms is that it works extremely well for those that are very low income, but above the Medicaid threshold, has no major impact on those getting insurance from a large business owner, and hurts those middle income and small business owners. Honestly a smart move for these employers would be to move to a defined contribution structure, where instead of buying insurance for employees, you provide a fixed dollar amount to put towards premiums bought on the marketplace. That would help alleviate the exorbitant premiums you're seeing in this example, as well as help keep costs controlled as you control the amount that any given employer is spending on these costs. That all said, it still wouldn't help a family if their employers don't want to provide anything to help, although it might be safe to assume in those situations, a person would be eligible for some tax credits or rebates. 

All that is a long way to say that the context here is pretty accurate and that people do have some fairly legitimate complaints about the system, but that what this doesn't show is the other side of all the uninsured who now have coverage and won't be bankrupted by even a minor illness

Employers are forbidden from banning employees from wearing religious garb (again, first amendment), unless it interferes with their job. Also, the case of Florida woman

Once again the CONservative right wing Evangelicals are playing the oppressed Christian minority card, when they're neither oppressed nor a minority. It's surprising they forgot to mention the War on Christmas (maybe we'll have to wait until the fall for that one). 

The fact that they all believe that Obama is an Anti-American Kenyan Muslim Communist dictator has clouded their ability to reason.

I'll just do a couple of points.

All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. Christianity and the bible are banned in schools.

Pertinent quote: As part of their social studies curriculum, Grade 7 pupils throughout California do study ancient Muslim cultures and the impact of Islam on world history...

All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons.

The ban was rescinded later.  I realize that some people might not consider the Washington Post to practise journalism.

I found these two citations with a couple of Google searches.  I consider the email to be exaggerated and truthy.
